									<h2>Course Description</h2>

									<br> <font size="4">This course explores the main debates on the causes and consequences of political violence. We will focus on three major topics: civil wars, state-sponsored violence, and terrorism. Since the end of World War II, domestic conflict has largely outpaced international wars as the dominant type of violence. But what makes civil wars so prevalent in recent years? What are the conditions under which a state decides to attack its own citizens? Why some groups resort to terrorism while others prefer nonviolent tactics? 
										<br>
										<br>
The class has three goals. First, students will become familiar with the literature on political violence, its most important debates and recent findings. Second, students should be able to evaluate research methods and critically assess distinct theoretical approaches. Lastly, the course will develop the students' writing skills by asking them to review academic articles and present a paper of their own by the end of the semester.
										<br>
										<br>

										<h3 id="course-information">Course Information</h3>
										<br>
										We will meet every Tuesday from 16:00 to 18:30 at <a href="http://brown.edu/Facilities/Facilities_Management/maps/index.php#building/VGQUADA">101 Thayer Street (VGQ 1st fl) 116B</a>. It is very important that you read the assigned readings before class. Students are encouraged to engage in critical discussions and are most welcome to express their views openly and freely. I would suggest you to bring some notes to the class so that we can discuss together the topics you find most interesting. Some of the texts make use of statistical models and game theory, but don't be intimidated by them. Feel free to skip the technical parts if they're too challenging and focus on the main ideas of the readings.
										<br>
										<br>

										All information about the course will be available at <a href="http://danilofreire.github.io/pols1824w">http://danilofreire.github.io/pols1824w</a>. The syllabus will be updated periodically according to the progress of the class. Please remember to visit the website regularly.
										<br>
										<br>
										I am very flexible when it comes to office hours, but it is easier to contact me via email. Feel free to send me a message any time at <a href="mailto:danilofreire@brown.edu">danilofreire@brown.edu</a>. I will probably reply in a few hours. You can also meet me in the afternoon at my office. I am in the Political Theory Project every weekday. My address is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8WhhyCNDHnw">8 Fones Alley, first floor, office 114</a>. If possible, please send me an email before coming to my office just to make sure two students will not book the same time slot.
										<br>
										<br>

										<h3 id="community-standards">Community Standards</h3>
										<br>
										Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all students. Please inform me early in the term if you have a disability or other conditions that might require accommodations or modification of any of these course procedures. You may speak with me after class or during office hours. For more information, please contact <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/accessibility-services/">Student and Employee Accessibility Services</a> at 401-863-9588 or <a href="mailto:SEAS@brown.edu">SEAS@brown.edu</a>. Students in need of short-term academic advice or support can contact one of the deans in the Dean of the College office.
										<br>
										<br>

										<h3 id="ell">English Language Learners</h3>
										<br>
										Brown University welcomes students from around the country and the world, and the unique perspectives international and multilingual students bring enrich the campus community. To empower multilingual learners, an array of support is available including language and culture workshops and individual appointments. For more information about English Language Learning support at Brown, contact the ELL Specialists at <a href="ellwriting@brown.edu">ellwriting@brown.edu</a>. No student will be penalised for their command of the English language.
										<br>
										<br>

										<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
										<br>
									Students will write three review reports and a longer essay for this course. All writing should be your own work, and I take plagiarism very seriously. I am happy to provide any help you may require with your lessons as long as you are committed to the course. It is also important to cite other people's work whenever necessary, and if in doubt, mention your sources. 
										<br>
										<br>

										<h3 id="no-laptop">No Electronic Device Policy</h3>
										<br>
								The readings of this course require attention and focus, and the topics we will discuss here are amongst the most complex in political science. Although electronic devices are important research tools, they are often distracting when used in class. Recent evidence shows that limiting the use of laptops substantially increases student participation and has a positive impact on grades. Thus, <i>this course has a strict ban on all electronic devices</i>, including laptops, tablets and mobile phones. The ban will be enforced as follows. The first time a student uses an electronic device in class, they will be issued a verbal warning. Students will suffer a -5% on their grades for each subsequent offense. Please govern yourselves properly.
	
								<br>
								<br>
								Students may petition for exemption from the technology ban by speaking to the instructor by the second week of the course. If an exemption is granted, students are expected to use the device as inconspicuously as possible in order to not distract their colleagues. 

										<br>
										<br>
										<h3 id="grading">Requirements and Grading</h3>
										<br>

										The means of evaluation includes three components:
										<br>
										<br>

										<ul>
											<li><b>Participation: 15%.</b> Students should be active participants in the course. Feel free to ask any question you may have, help others if you know how, and make suggestions or comments you believe are interesting. I hope we create a friendly, open environment for learning and students are the most important part of it.</li>
											<br>
											<li><b>Three Rewiew Reports: 45%.</b> The reviews should be 3-5 pages long. Imagine you are a reviewer for a good academic journal and think of how you could help the author improve the article. Are the arguments well-developed in the text? Is the research design plausible? What further examples could the author include to strenghten his/her arguments? Try to provide as much constructive criticism as possible. You don't need to summarise the paper, just critically engage with it. You should write one paper for each section of the course (civil wars, mass killings, and terrorism), but you're free to choose any reading you prefer. The essays are due at the beginning of the class and late assignments will not be eligible for an A. Each report will account for 15% of your grade.</li>
											<br>
											<li><b>Final Project: 40%.</b> In the final project, students will have the opportunity to write a longer essay about a topic that interests them. The essay should be related to the readings of the course, but you are particularly encouraged to explore new ideas and use new data to test their hypotheses. Students can work in groups of up to three people as most academic research is currenty done collaboratively. By the second week of the course, students should submit a one-page summary of their future essay. The instructor and two colleagues will review the paper proposal and give the authors constructive feedback. Students will then write a full draft during the term. In the last week of the course, students will present their findings to the class and receive feedback from their colleagues. The final paper is due one week after that. 
											</li>
