# Two week ago, we saw that

.font150[
* There has been many waves of terrorist activities, from the French Revolution to Radical Islamism today

* Jacobins, Narodnaya Volnya, Irish nationalists, Young Bosnia, anti-colonial movements, left-wing terrorist groups, Al Qaeda, etc

* Terrorist has been used both by governments and by non-state actors

* Use of violence of threats of violence to intimidate others, directly or indirectly, to achieve political goals

# Two week ago, we saw that

.font140[
* We also discussed some situations in which terrorism might be morally acceptable
  - Groups facing oppression, extreme violations of human rights

* Moral issues: 
  - Disrespect for war conventions, targeting innocent civilians, intent is difficult to justify

* Different definitions of terorrism have significant impact over our analyses

* Often a rational strategy, but it doesn't always work

# The strategies of terrorism

.font150[
* "Terrorism often works."  

* Between 1980 and 2003, half of all suicide terrorism campaigns resulted in concessions by the government 

* "Hijacking planes, blowing up buses, and kidnapping individuals [...] can be surprisingly effective"

* For counter-terrorism strategies to work it is important to understand what those groups want and whether/how they achieve their goals
]

# The strategies of terrorism 

.font150[
* They seek to answer four questions:
  - What types of goals do terrorists seek to achieve?
  - What strategies do they pursue to achieve these goals?
  - Why do these strategies work in some cases but not in others?  
  - What are the targeted governmentsâ€™ best responses to prevent terrorism and protect their countries from future attacks?

* Main explanatory variable: _costly signalling_
]

# The goals of terrorism   

.font150[
* The press usually portraits terrorists groups as crazy extremists

* This is particularly true for _suicide terrorism_

* Individuals have different motivations from their groups
  - Suicide bombers may seek financial benefits for their family or a pleasant afterlife
  - Organisations have political goals

* Political goals have changed over time, as we have seen 
]

# The goals of terrorism 

.font150[
* The authors find five broad goals of terrorist groups
  - Regime change (Sendero Luminoso, Hezbollah, Taliban)
  - Territorial change (Tamil Tigers, Lashkar-e Tayyiba in Kashmir)
  - Policy change (Al-Qaeda, Hamas)
  - Social control (KKK, Fascist regimes)
  - Status quo maintenance (LatAm paramilitaries, IRA)

* Regime change is the most common, followed by territorial change

* Many organisations have multiples goals
]

---

# The strategies of terrorist violence

* So how do terrorist groups try to achieve their goals?

* The authors argue that _uncertainty_ and _costly signalling_ provide a good explanation
--
.font150[
* **Uncertainty**: groups don't know what their enemies can do or how committed they are to a given policy 
 
*
