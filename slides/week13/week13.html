# Last week we saw that

.font150[
* Suicide terrorists might not be rational, but their leaders surely are

* Suicide terrorism is an extreme example of _costly signalling_, used to show commitment to the cause and resolve to fight

* It often works, but only when it targets non-essential functions of the state

* Terrorist strategies include: attrition, provocation, spoiling, intimidation, and outbidding
]

# Last week we saw that 

.font140[
* People who join terrorist organisations also share some characteristics:

  - Feeling of anger and disenfranchisement
  - The perception that conventional political activity does not work
  - Identification with victims
  - Beliefs that violence is not immoral
  - Sense of reward, material or not
  - Strong social ties with other members

* Engineers are particularly overrepresented in Islamic terrorist groups

# Why terrorism does not work

.center[![:scale 100%](a00.png)]

---

# Introduction

.font150[
* The prevailing view in political science was that terrorism is an effective strategies

* Terrorist groups are often able to gain concessions from the target government or other opposition groups
  - First Palestinian Intifada forced the Israel gov't to negotiate and the UN to adopt the principle of a two-state solution

* If terrorism works, it is a major issue in democracies: it indicates that indiscriminate violence works well

* Other groups may be tempted to use terrorist tactics too
]

---

# Introduction

.font150[
* Terrorism supposedly works because it increases the bargaining power of the weaker groups (the terrorists)

* The effect should be particularly pronounced in democracies:
  - Less likely to use violence, more likely to dialogue with the opposition, free press allows terrorists to publicise their attacks

* Two readings we discussed last class affirm that this is the case

* _This article contests their findings_
]

---

# Measuring terrorism's effectiveness 

.font150[
* He claims that Kydd and Walter (2006) and Pape (2003) use a very small number of cases, and focus almost exclusively on Hamas and the Tamil Tigers

* These are not representative cases as they are one of the few that have succeeded

* If you add a larger number of groups in the analysis, the results change substantially

* This work includes 28 terrorist groups as classified by the US Department of State

* He measures terrorism' success in terms of policy concessions from target governments

# Measuring terrorism's effectiveness  

.font150[
* Both "total success" and "partial success" are counted as successes

* Only 3 successes in 42 cases: 
	- Hezbollah in 1984 and 2000
	- Tamil Tigers from 1990

* As a comparison, economic sanctions are widely considered as policy failures, yet they have a rate of success of ~35%

* _Terrorism doesn't pay_
]

---

# When terrorism works 

.font150[
* Terrorists have multiple goals, so it's tricky to evaluate their success rate

* But most terrorist groups do not achieve success regardless of the goals

* The best predictor of success is _target selection_

* Groups whose attacks on civilian targets outnumbered attacks on military targets systematically failed to achieve their policy objective
]

---

# Limited and maximalist objectives

.font150[
* Limited objectives are usually demands over territory, natural resources, or autonomy (not secession)

* Maximalist objectives, in turn, refer to demands over beliefs and ideologies

* Are objectives correlated with success? 
]

---

# Limited and maximalist objectives 

.center[![:scale 100%](a03.png)]

.font150[
* **Question**: if terrorist groups with maximalist objectives have so little chance of success, why do such groups still exist?]
---

# Target selection

.font150[
* We've just seen that different objectives lead to different outcomes

* What about target selection?

* Terrorists usually have two targets
	- Civilians
	- Military personnel

* Does killing civilians increase the chance of policy concessions?
]

---

# Target selection 

.center[![:scale 100%](a04.png)]

---

# Why attacking civilians is ineffective

.font150[
* The author develops a theory  for why terrorist groups do not achieve their policy objectives

* Remember costly signalling and uncertainty? 

* His theory is based on uncertainty:
	- Terrorists miscommunicate their intents by being violent

* States do not get the "right" signals
]

---

# Why attacking civilians is ineffective 

.center[![:scale 100%](a05.png)]

---

# Why attacking civilians is ineffective 

.font150[
* Assumption: _people attribute the behaviour of others to inherent characteristics of their personality—or dispositions—rather than to external or situational factors_" (p 58)

* "_Attribute-effect linkage_":  the objectives of the actor are presumed to be encoded in the outcome of the behaviour

* Thus, the observer assumes the intentions based on what they see, not on what the senders wanted to say
]

---

# States and terrorist attacks 

.font140[
* Since terrorism involves attacks to innocent civilians and the objectives of the group are not immediately apparent, states make inferences under uncertainty

* States believe terrorists are not protesting against any type of oppression, but are interested in destroying the population _per se_

* If that is the case, almost every attack against civilians _will be understood as a reflection of maximalist goals_, that is, the existence of the state itself

* As a result, states will strongly react against terrorist groups
]

---

# Case study: US response to 9/11  

.font150[
* The author argues that Al Qaeda provides a good example for his theory

* After  9/11, the American public and authorities have focused on _the effects_ of Al Qaeda's attacks instead of analysing their _rationale_

* This has led Americans to infer that Al Qaeda wanted to destroy _the whole political and economic system_, not to gain limited, plausible concessions as the group originally intended
]

---

# Al Qaeda's stated objectives

.font150[
* According to the author, Al Qaeda's objectives were very clear from the start:
	- Remove the American presence in Saudi Arabia
	- Stop US interventions that kill Muslims around the world
	- End US support for pro-Western Muslim regimes, such as Pakistan's
	- End US support for Israel

* But these goals have not been discussed after the attacks 
]

---

# Effects trump rationale 

.font150[
* "The British journalist Robert Fisk similarly observed that after the August 1998 attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, US leaders emphasized the carnage and devastation, but "not in a single press statement, press conference, or interview did a US leader or diplomat explain why the enemies of America hate America"

* Bush: "[Al Qaeda] hates not our policies, but our existence"

* Similarly, he said that Al Qaeda wanted to curtail "our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other"
]

---

# Effects trump rationale  

.font150[
* However, the author states that _Al Qaeda never mentioned that_

* Their videos and manifestos were mute on these topics

* Instead of attacking because "we [Al Qaeda] hate freedom", the attacks are a response to the fact that "you [US] spoil our security" and "attack us"

* Thus, the American government inferred that Al Qaeda had maximalist goals

* As a response, the "War on Terror" ensued 
]

---

# Effects trump rationale  

.font150[
* To be honest, the US would not be willing to fully compromise anyway

* But maybe it wouldn't have taken many steps directly against Al Qaeda's main plans
	- Increase support for Israel, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia
	- Invade two Muslim countries
	- Take a more aggressive stance on terrorism worldwide

* **Question**: what do you think of his reading of Al Qaeda's main goals?

* What about the Russian and Israeli examples that he gives?

# Terrorists who don't kill 

.center[![:scale 100%](r00.png)]

---

# Terrorists who don't kill  

.font150[
* When most people think of terrorism, they likely think of some form of carnage

* But this is not always the case

* Most terrorist groups actually _don't kill anyone_ (!)

* From 395 groups the authors gathered information from, only 39% of them murdered someone

* Thinking of our discussion of costly signalling, that doesn't make much sense

* _Why don't they kill more people?_
]

---

# Terrorists who don't kill   

.font150[
* Some scholars argue that terrorists who don't kill are simply not terrorists

* They might be aggressive or annoying, but should be classified differently

* **Question**: should the KKK still be classified as terrorist if they don't kill anyone?

* What is the relationship between violence and terrorism?
]
--
.font150[
* Should the _threat_ of violence count as terrorism too?
]

---

# Why not kill?

.font150[
* Organisations use certain frames to help them interpret the world

* Some of those frames are more open to violence than others

* Religion is particularly potent because its adherents are attempting to address a divine audience

* (...and Gods are often bloodthirsty)

* Yet there are religious groups that do not use violence:
	- Hizb ut-Tahrir doesn't use violence, although many countries don't allow them to speak openly about their views
]

	---

# Why not kill? 

* Although there are exceptions, religious groups in general are more likely to use violence

* 65% of Islamic organizations have killed between 1998 and 2005

* 70% of organizations that mix religion and ethnonationalism have killed over the same period

* However, some other ideologies are openly against violence too...

# Earth Liberation Front

.font150[
* The ELF is a movement that defends animal rights and was founded in the UK in the early 1990s

* Since 1998 they have carried dozens of attacks, mainly targeting factories

* Indeed, they have rarely killed anyone

* But should they be considered a terrorist group?

* Which other groups are also not violent but may be classified as terrorists?
