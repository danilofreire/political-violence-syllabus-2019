# Last week we saw that

.font140[
* A great number of genocides occur during or after civil/international wars

* Barbara Harff suggests that there are a few preconditions of genocide:
	- Political upheavals, prior genocides, exclusionary ideologies, ethnic/religious cleavages, low economic development

* Countries with any of these variables have higher risk of genocides

* Political and economic interdependence can mitigate genocide risk 
]

# Last week we saw that

.font130[
* Gary Uzonyi argues that not only actual threats, but _perceived_ threats to elites can cause genocide

* Politicides and genocides might have different logics: 
	- While genocides are motivated by the goal of exterminating a particular group
	- Politicides tend to be more affected by domestic unrest, as they are used to maintain a government's stability

* Domestic unrest should increase the risk of politicide, but not that of genocide

* However, he does not find robust evidence for his hypotheses

# Last week we saw that

.font150[
* Valentino and his colleagues argue that killing civilians is a calculated strategy to combat guerrillas

* As it is difficult to fight guerrillas directly, states target their base of support

* Results show that countries with higher population, guerrillas, and civilian support are more likely to see mass killings

* Democracy seems to deter mass killings too

# Last week we saw that

.font150[
* Jay Ulfelder affirms that the best way to predict genocide is by combining a large number of models

* Genocides and politicides are rare events, thus very difficult to predict 

* Ensemble models increase predictive accuracy and adds uncertainty to the estimations

* Tests model validity by leaving some data out and measuring how well the model performs with unseen data

* Early Warning Project and Genocide Watch

# Overview 

.font140[
* UN's Responsibility to Protect (R2P) implies that the international community should prevent genocides, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity

* Global compact created in 2005 and it consists of three pillars:
	- Protection responsibility by the state; international assistance; timely and decisive response

* Evoked several times by the UNSC:
	- Kenya, Libya, Syria, CAR, etc

* But is that the best way to end genocides?

# Overview 

.font140[
* "Best of all worlds" trap: if we can't do what is best, we don't do anything at all

* If we look closely at the data, some unexpected patterns emerge

* Most cases of genocide de-escalated after the perpetrators achieved their goals

* External military interventions account for a small part of the de-escalations

# Mass killings termination

.font150[
* We have no good data about how genocides end

* The author has three suggestions:
  - Look at the determinants of civil war onset, civil war duration, and the causes of mass killings
  - Try an inductive approach by analysing how state-sponsored mass killings have ended in the past
  - The literature on external interventions
]

.font150[
* Let's start with the first one and take a look at the most recent UCDP/PRIO dataset

# Civil war termination

.font140[
* Although these data provide some guidance...

* ... factors that end mass killing do not necessarily end civil war

* For instance, mass killings may happen before or during conflicts

* Genocides can also be unrelated to wars

* Studies focused only on the causes of mass killings offer little help
  - Killings might end without addressing the cause
  - Mass killings _causes_ are different from their _logics_ 

]

---

# Duration of civil wars

.font150[
* We only have good evidence that low GDP per capita and lootable resources increase the duration of civil wars
