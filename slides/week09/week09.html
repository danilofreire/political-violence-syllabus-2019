# Last week we saw that

.font140[
* A great number of genocides occur during or after civil/international wars

* Barbara Harff suggests that there are a few preconditions of genocide:
	- Political upheavals, prior genocides, exclusionary ideologies, ethnic/religious cleavages, low economic development

* Countries with any of these variables have higher risk of genocides

* Political and economic interdependence can mitigate genocide risk 
]
---

# Last week we saw that

.font130[
* Gary Uzonyi argues that not only actual threats, but _perceived_ threats to elites can cause genocide

* Politicides and genocides might have different logics: 
	- While genocides are motivated by the goal of exterminating a particular group
	- Politicides tend to be more affected by domestic unrest, as they are used to maintain a government's stability

* Domestic unrest should increase the risk of politicide, but not that of genocide

* However, he does not find robust evidence for his hypotheses 
]
---

# Last week we saw that

.font150[
* Valentino and his colleagues argue that killing civilians is a calculated strategy to combat guerrillas

* As it is difficult to fight guerrillas directly, states target their base of support

* Results show that countries with higher population, guerrillas, and civilian support are more likely to see mass killings

* Democracy seems to deter mass killings too 
]
---

# Last week we saw that

.font150[
* Jay Ulfelder affirms that the best way to predict genocide is by combining a large number of models

* Genocides and politicides are rare events, thus very difficult to predict 

* Ensemble models increase predictive accuracy and adds uncertainty to the estimations

* Tests model validity by leaving some data out and measuring how well the model performs with unseen data

* Early Warning Project and Genocide Watch

# Overview 

.font140[
* UN's Responsibility to Protect (R2P) implies that the international community should prevent genocides, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity

* Global compact created in 2005 and it consists of three pillars:
	- Protection responsibility by the state; international assistance; timely and decisive response

* Evoked several times by the UNSC:
	- Kenya, Libya, Syria, CAR, etc

* But is that the best way to end genocides?
]

---

# Overview 

.font140[
* "Best of all worlds" trap: if we can't do what is best, we don't do anything at all

* If we look closely at the data, some unexpected patterns emerge

* Most cases of genocide de-escalated after the perpetrators achieved their goals

* External military interventions account for a small part of the de-escalations
]

---

# Mass killings termination

.font150[
* We have no good data about how genocides end

* The author has three suggestions:
  - Look at the causes of mass killings, the determinants of civil war duration, and the effect of external interventions
  - Try an inductive approach and analyse how state-sponsored mass killings have ended in the past
]
--

.font150[
* Let's start with the first one 
]

---

# Causes of mass killings

.font150[
* Last week we saw some of the causes of mass killings
  - Civil wars, guerrillas, political threats to the elites, discrimination against ethnic or religious groups

* Although this literature provides some guidance...

* ... it might not help us very much here. 
]
--

.font140[
* **Why?**
 ]

--

.font150[
* Factors that _cause_ mass killing might not be the same that those which account for _mass killing duration_
]

---

# Causes of mass killings

.font150[
* Some mass killings do not achieve the perpetrators' purposes

* Elites might be divided during the conflict

* Not all genocides or politicides happen in times of war
]

--

.font150[
* No reason to think that the elimination of causes will end mass killing
]

---

# Duration of civil wars

.font140[
* Some civil wars last much longer than others

* Since early 2000s, researchers have investigated which factors explain civil war duration

* As with the literature on civil war onset, there are only a few robust indicators associated with longer wars:
  - Low GDP per capita
  - Lootable resources
  - External support for rebels
]
--

.font140[
* But these factors might play a different role in genocides. **Question**: How would the variables above affect mass killings? 
]

---

# Role of third parties

.font150[
* We've already discussed that peacekeeping operations can reduce the duration of civil wars

* The author says it might not be the case with genocides. **Why?** Can you think of two possible mechanisms?
]
--

.font150[
* Real or perceived threats to leaders
]
--

.font150[
* If the third parties do not show resolve, leaders can be even more motivated to carry on the attacks  
]
---

# How mass killings end: Findings

.font150[
* The author identified 65 cases of genocides between 1945 and 2009

* Perpetrators themselves ended a majority of cases
  - Either because their goals
  - Or because they changed their goals
  
* This is changing since the end of the Cold War

* Negotiating ends are rare

* Some episodes end in regime change by domestic groups (more common) or external interventions

# Implications

.font150[
* Regime change is becoming more prevalent as a means to end genocides

* Domestic actors are more successful than international interventions in changing repressive regimes

* But both mitigate atrocities

* **Question**: if you were a policy-maker, what would you do to stop mass killings? What are the pros and cons of each strategy?

# Matthew Krain (2005)

.font150[
* As we've seen before, the UN has increasingly discussed the used of international interventions 

* The international community frustrated expectations in Bosnia, Timor Leste, Darfur, etc

* Recent failured have raised questions about the effectiveness of interventions in foreign countries

* We have already discussed the role of peacekeeping operations (PKOs) in civil wars, but how do they affect the incidence of mass killings?
]

---

# PKOs, civil wars, and genocides

.font150[
* Most research has focused on the interaction between PKOs and civil war duration

* However, genocides pose a much harder problem for the UN

* "In a matter of 100 days, almost 800,000 people were slaughtered in Rwanda, a rate of approximately 8,000 per day"

* Genocide duration is not correlated with genocide severity
]
---

# PKOs, civil wars, and genocides

.font150[
* A major question is that PKOs can have heterogeneous effects on mass killings

* While it can force perpetrators to stop the violence...

* It can also increase the pressure over them and accelerate the rate of murders

* Also, even PKOs can't stop the killings, they might reduce the levels of violence
]
---

# PKOs, civil wars, and genocides

.font150[
* While in civil wars PKOs can choose a side to collaborate with, in genocides there is only _one_ group making the decisions

* This makes the situation harder as the target population by definition can't help

* Thus, the author says, _the motivations of the intervention don't matter_, as PKO's only chance of success lies in stopping the perpetrator by any means

* **Question**: do you agree?
]
---

# Intervention models

.font150[
* Three strategies don't seem to work:

* Do nothing

* Neutral interventions

* Aiding the perpetrator

* What seems to work: directly challenge the perpetrator

* **Why?**
]
---

# Other factors

.font150[
* Duration: the longer the genocide, the more the leaders learn how to kill more efficiently

* Previous conflicts: leaders know that they can continue genocidal policies, or past grievances can increase the likelihood of future mass killings

* Contiguity: contiguous states can either increase or decrease the severity of violence
]

---

# Other factors

.font150[
* Regime type: democracies are more peaceful than dictatorships

* Ethnic fractionalisation 

* Economic marginalisation: increase the severity of mass killings. How do they affect *the perpetrator*?
