# Last week we saw that... 

.font150[
* C&H propose a greed-based theory of civil wars

* Grievance are constant, so civil wars need another triggering factor

* Opportunity: rebel groups revolt when they're able to

* Lootable resources, money from diasporas and hostile governments, and low costs of fighting (poverty) explain civil war onset

# Last week we saw that... 

.font150[
* F&L argue that state capability is the most important civil war predictor

* Also proxied by GDP, like C&H's opportunity variable

* Ethnic and religious heterogeneity don't matter once you control for income

* Factors that favour insurgency (mountainous terrain, oil, unstable regimes) increase the risk of civil wars

# Last week we saw that... 

.font150[
* Wimmer et al (2009) write ethnicity does play a role in civil wars

* Ethnicity is useful because politicians mobilise it

* Secession, rebellion, or group infighting

* Excluded population fight for the first two, included groups for the latter (sometimes for secession too)

# Last week we saw that... 

.font150[
* Most variables don't have strong predictive power

* GDP per capita and population are the best predictors of civil conflicts

* Statistical significance is not the same as practical or predictive significance

# Some context

.font150[
* The Algerian Civil War lasted from 1991 to 2002

* Islamist groups vs the government 

* Onset: government cancelled 1991 elections after the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) would win

* FIS was banned and members arrested, Islamist guerrillas rebelled against the government

* Two main rebel groups: Islamic Armed Movement (MIA) and Armed Islamic Group (GIA)
]
---

# Some context

.font150[
* In 1994, talks between FIS and the government took place

* GIA declared war against FIS

* Pro-Army party won the next election (1997)

* MIA surrended and GIA were hunted down

* 1996-1999 peak violence; civil war ends in 2002 (government victory)
]

# Some context

.font150[
* *La sale guerre*  

* 44,000 to 100,000 deaths

* Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), a GIA dissident group, later affiliated with Al-Qaeda and continue fighting in the Maghreb
]

# Kalyvas (1999)

.font150[
* Rational choice approach to mass violence

* Massacres are not acts of barbarism, but a war strategy

* Violence maximises civilian support under constrains

* Illustrates his case using the Algerian Civil War as an example

# Kalyvas (1999)

.font150[
* Why would political organisations kill civilians randomly?

* Specifically, why would *insurgents*, who tend to be weaker, kill civilians?
