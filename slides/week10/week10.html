# Last week we saw that

.font150[
* Genocides are hard to prevent, maybe even harder than civil wars

* Leaders are often resolute in their decisions to attack civilians

* Peace-keeping operations reduce the duration and incidence of mass killings

* But they are deployed only to the worst cases

* Previous conflicts predict both mass killings and PKO deployment
]
---

# Last week we saw that

.font150[
* Most genocides end when the perpetrators achieve their goals

* Recently, domestic opposition groups and international interventions have succeeded in ending genocide

* PKO used to side with the perpetrators, yet there's evidence that they only work when they support the opposition

* There's no evidence that economic sanctions work in reducing the chances of genocide outbreak or duration

# Uses and abuses of the term

.font140[
* Terrorism is a grossly overused term

* Most people have an idea of what it is, yet terrorism is not very precisely defined

* The confusion has gotten worse in the last decades

* "[...] virtually any especially abhorrent act of violence perceived as directed against society [...] is often labelled "terrorism"
    - religious terrorism, ecoterrorism, "corporate terrorism", etc
    
* The meaning of what is illegitimate violence has changed over time

* Widespread fear of counterrevolution

* Threats of foreign invasion from Austria and Prussia

# Maximilien Robespierre

.font150[
_If the basis of popular government in peacetime is virtue, the basis of popular government during a revolution is both virtue and terror; virtue, without which terror is baneful; terror, without which virtue is powerless. Terror is nothing more than speedy, severe and inflexible justice; it is thus an emanation of virtue; it is less a principle in itself, than a consequence of the general principle of democracy, applied to the most pressing needs of the homeland_

Robespierre, February 1794

# Palestine Liberation Organisation

.font150[
* The Palestine Liberation Organisation is largely considered the most significant terrorist group in the Middle East until the rise of Al Qaeda

# What is terrorism?

.font150[
* Early terrorists were happy to use the term to describe themselves

* Robespierre, the Narodnaya Volya, both openly said that terror was their main goal

* Later, the term gained a pejorative tone and no organisation today states that they are a terrorist group
    - "Liberation Front", "Popular Liberation Army", "Resistance Movement", etc
    
* _Terrorist is our enemy_
]
---

# Humanitarian law

.font150[
* Arafat: "_people who struggle to liberate themselves from foreign oppression and exploitation have the right to use all methods at their disposal, including force._"

* However, there is some order in war, too: humanitarian law

* Terrorists have widely disregarded those rules
    - Attack innocent civilians, torturing POWs, violate neutral territories, etc
    
* Terrorists also attack other countries that have no connection with their goals
]
---

# Definitions

.font150[
* Alex Schmid, author of "Political Terrorism: A Research Guide", devotes _more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definitions of terrorism_

* Walter Laqueur did not even try to define terrorism in his work

* But we need a working definition of terrorism to know our object of study
]
---

# Definitions

.font150[
* Contrast terrorism with civil war: guerrillas often control parts of the territory, openly identify themselves, and use propaganda to mobilise supporters, etc. Terrorist groups generally don't

* Contrast terrorism with ordinary criminals: purpose of violence is not the same. Criminals have selfish reasons and do not intent to cause broad consequences

* Contrast terrorism with "lunatic assassins": goals of the assassin are idiosyncratic and deeply personal. Often are apolitical
]
---

# Definitions

.font150[
* Few characteristics:
    - ineluctably political in aims and motives;
    - violent—or, equally important, threatens violence;
    - designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions;
    - conducted either by an organization or by individuals with a clear inspiration from the leaders; and
    - perpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity
    
* **Question**: do you agree with all those terms? Why or why not?

# Theoretical puzzle

.font150[
* Increasing resistance to acknowledging the possibility of state terrorism

* Police violence or military actions can be classified as terrorism

* Image of "brown-skinned Arab or Muslim looking terrorist"

* This obscures other types of terrorism, such as lynching, crossburnings or gay-bashing

* _We need a more comprehensive understanding of terrorism_
]
---

# Proposed definition of terrorism

.font150[
* She argues that a definition needs to meet the following criteria:

* Conservative: disturbs existing usage as little as possible

* Consistency and non-arbitrariness: improve consistency

* Precision: help differentiate among phenomena that may otherwise be confused

* Impartiality: resist moral arbitrariness and bias
]
---

# Purposes and goals of terrorism

.font150[
* Short term: create a climate of terror

* Long term: depends
    - right to war (_ius ad bellum_) and _ius in bellum_ (humanitarian law)
    
* Not all terrorist groups have unjust goals

* Also, civilians can cooperate with unjust governments too, so they are not considered innocent 
]
---

# Proposed definition of terrorism:

.font150[
_Terrorism is the use of extreme threats or violence designed to intimidate or subjugate governments, groups, or individuals. It is a tactic of coercion intended to promote further ends that in themselves may be good, bad or indifferent. Terrorism may be practiced by governments or international bodies or forces, sub-state groups or even individuals. Its threats or violence are aimed directly or immediately at the bodies or belongings of innocent civilians but these are typically terrorists’ secondary targets; the primary targets of terrorists are the governments, groups or individuals that they wish to intimidate._ (p. 209)
]
---

# Moral dimensions of terrorism

.font150[
* She claims that terrorism is always morally repugnant: it involves coercion and violence

* Terrorists attack those who do not represent a threat to them

* But can it ever be justified? 

* **What do you think?**
]
---

# Moral dimensions of terrorism 

.font150[
* Some argue that violence is always immoral

* However: "_Terrorism is certainly heinous but that something is heinous does not entail that it is prohibited in all circumstances; it merely entails that anyone wishing to argue its moral permissibility bears a heavy burden of proof." (p. 213)

* Extreme circumstances require extreme actions?
]
---

# Moral dimensions of terrorism 

.font150[
* Seven criteria to justify terrorism:
    - Just cause
    - Competent authority
    -  Right intention
    - Proportionality
    - Last resort
    -  Reasonable hope of success
    - The aim of peace
    
* How would you classify the following groups according to those criteria: Al Qaeda, Russian anarchists, French revolutionaries, Latin American _guerrilleros_?

# How definitions impact research

.font150[
* Research on terrorism has increased substantially since 9/11

* But as we've seen, scholars cannot agree on a definition of terrorism

* What is the impact of different definitions on research results?

* They survey 9 political science journals since 1980

* Domestic versus international terrorism should be seen as different processes
]
---

# Defining terrorism

.font150[
* Qualitative, case-study work has dominated the terrorism literature for decades.

*  Scholars define terrorism to fit the case(s) under study

* **Problem:** what defines terrorism in one country (i.e., fighting colonial powers) may not explain other types of terrorism

* **Solution:** analyse the cases separately, as there is enough variation in the datasets  to explore differences in definitions 
]
---

# Different types of terrorism

.font150[
* Dozens of different typologies

* Not all of them useful to predict future cases 

* **Problem:**  much attention has been given to the perpetrators and victims of the violence, but much less attention has been given _to the targets_

* **Solution:** differentiate between the country of origin of the terrorists and their target countries. Assume that domestic terrorism have different causes from international attacks
]
---

# Unit of observation

.font150[
* Most studies analyse one country at a time, mostly the one which suffered the violence

* This does not tell us much about transnational terrorism

* **Problem:**  it is unclear which unit of analysis we should use

* **Solution:** sometimes it is useful to analyse terrorism _in pairs_, that is, ISIS attacks in Pakistan are not the same as ISIS attacks in France
