Department of Political Science, Stanford

Has written extensively about civil and international wars, often using game theory and statistical modelling

"_Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War_" (2003, with David Laitin)

"_Rationalist Explanations for War_" (1995)
]
]

# Fearon (1995)

.font150[
* Wars are always costly:
  - Destroy infrastructure
  - Disrupt trade
  - Kill both soldiers and civilians
  - Victory is often uncertain
]
--
.font150[
* _Why would rational people go to war, then?_
]
---

# Fearon (1995) 

.font150[
* Three explanations:
	- Leaders are sometimes or always irrational
	- Leaders can free ride: benefits at no cost 
	-_Leaders calculate the costs and benefits and go to war anyway_
]

.font150[
* Three mechanisms:
	- Bluffing
	- Commitment problems
	- Issue indivisibility
]
---

# Wanted and Unwanted Wars

.font150[
* Wars are _always inefficient ex post_

* Both sides would be better off by bargaining (lower costs)

* Unless people enjoy war, it is always better to find cheaper _ex ante_ solutions
	- Question: was that ever the case? Examples?
]

# Flawed Arguments

.font150[
* _Anarchy_
]
--
.font120[
* if war is costly regardless of outcome, why is it ever employed?
]
--
.font150[
* _Preventive war_ 
]
--
.font120[
* why couldnâ€™t the states construct a bargain that would leave both sides better off? 
]
--
.font150[
* _Positive expected utility_ 
]
--
.font120[
* there always exists an _ex ante_ bargaining space
