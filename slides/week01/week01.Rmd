	- What about crime? Are societies in general more violent than they were 60 years ago? 
	- Are Western countries more likely to be victims of terrorism?]

# Large wars as black swans

.font150[
* Cirilo and Taleb (2015) make two important comments:

	- 1) The Law of Large Numbers converges much more slowly in fat-tailed distributions
	- "We require more data to assert that there are no black swans than to assert that there are black swans"
	- 2) The means are misleading with dealing with extreme events
	- "for fat-tailed variables, the mean is almost entirely determined by extremes. If you are uncertain about the tails, then you are uncertain about the mean"

# Gohdes and Price (2012) 

.font150[
* What if our data are wrong?

* PRIO is the most important think-tank for peace studies 

* The PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset is widely used in academia

* G&P argue that the dataset has a lot of *missing data* and the data is prone to *measurement error*
]
---

# Gohdes and Price (2012)

.font150[
* Issues of data quality:
	- No reliable estimates for many conflicts, specially before 1980
	- E.g.: "for the Persian Gulf War in Iraq in 1991, the PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset gives a disaggregated best estimate of 28,245, a low estimate of 1,545, and a high estimate of 43,245 killed in combat situations" (p. 1095)
	- Which one should we believe in? The best, high or low? 
]
---

# Gohdes and Price (2012)

.font150[
* Issues of data availability:
	- No yearly data available for most conflicts before 1980
	- Interpolate mean yearly estimates according to qualitative knowledge of the case, when available
	- E.g.: "60.2 percent of the units before 1975 do not even include information on conflict-internal trends." (p. 1096)

* _Very rarely_: only if we have an idea of how the true population looks like. 

* _We often don't_

* Some statistical procedures can approximate it, but only with a lot of uncertainty

* They replicate the analysis using heteroskedasticity-robust clustered standard errors and polynomial trends

# Lacina and Gleditsch (2012)

.font150[
* Issues of data quality:
	- Best estimate is missing for some years, and in others there are two or more estimates available
	- Conflicts tend to be short: interpolation isn't a great problem
	- Armies are good record-keepers
	- Applying smoothing functions work better than arbitrary model assumptions

# Underestimates or overestimates?

.font150[
* The authors argue that:
	- Media reports tend to underestimate battle deaths
	- Academic scrutiny corrects eventual errors in data
	- Experts and NGOs tend to overestimate conflict size
	- Thus, the biases can go in both directions

* _What do you think?_

# To sum up...

.font150[
* Short-term and negativity biases are always present in media reports

* Long-run trend for the economy is very robust (and it's going up)

* Long-run trend for war and peace.... is a bit less robust

* International and civil wars are indeed much more rare

* And so are many other types of violence

* ... but for how long? 
]
---

# To sum up...

.font150[
* The best way to improve those estimates is to understand _cause and effect_

* Knowing whether A causes B allows us to make better predictions about the future

* And this is what we will do in this course:
	- Discuss recent theories about civil wars, genocides, and terrorism
	- See their limitations and think about how to improve them
	- Hopefully, have fun along the way!
